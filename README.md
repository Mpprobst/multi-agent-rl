# Policy Gradients in Multi-Agent Environments
Developed by Diego Andrade, Subash Khanal, and Michael Probst.

## Overview
This reposistory contains an attempt to solve multi-agent environments using policy gradients. We attempted to simulate individually-minded and group-minded agents to simulate selfish and team-oriented interactions, respectively. This repo made use of the of MADDPG code in https://github.com/openai/maddpg  and  Multi-agent Environments as in https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs.

## Using this repo
A simple scenario can be run by entering the command `python controller.py` which will run in default settings. There are more parameters that can be used to modify the test that you want to run. Enter `python controller.py --help` for more info on those parameters.
